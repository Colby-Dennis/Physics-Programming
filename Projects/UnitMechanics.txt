Unit XX: Classical Mechanics
The objective of this unit is to learn how to apply different time 
    evolution algorithms to simulate mechanical systems.

* The files should be output in a csv format so that the simulation can
    be animated using another program such as blender or p5js.

* Have the outputs be in a 24 FPS (frames per second) output

* Include a log file that will track the time it takes the program to
    run.

02.01: Double Pendulum with Euler Method.
    - Create a program that simulates a double pendulum using the Euler
        method.
    - Both masses and rod lengths of the double pendulum are to be equal.
    - Use an input file that takes in the following initial conditions:
        * length (length of the two rods)
        * theta1 (starting angle for the first mass)
        * theta2 (starting angle of the second mass)
        * time (the total time the simulation runs)
        * timeMultiplier (delta time is a multiple of 24 FPS)
    - Output data in the format:
        t, x1, y1, x2, y2, energy
    - Log the starting energy and final energy along with the
        program run time.
