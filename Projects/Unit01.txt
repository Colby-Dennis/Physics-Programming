Unit 01: Basic Workflow tools
The objective of this unit is to get the user familiar with the basics of 
    handling inputs, outputs, and program structure.

* For each of the following programs, utilize a Makefile to build
    the executable. 

* Each executable should have the name "exer####" where the first
    two number are the unit number and the last two are the 
    exercise number.

* Structure the exercise program as followed within the unit folder

    Unit##
    | -Exercise##
      | -Program
        | <PROGRAM GOES HERE>

01.01: Compiling Programs
    - Create a program that writes "Hello World!" to the terminal.

01.02: Compiling in other directories
    - Repeat exercise 01.01 but have the executable be built in the 
        bin folder.
    - All executables from this point are expected to be in the bin 
        folder.

01.03: Reading from a file
    - Create an input folder called "Inputs" within the exercise 
        folder.
    - Create a text file called input.txt.
    - Put a single decimal number in the input.txt file.
    - Have the program read from the input.txt file and print out
        the square of the number in the terminal.
    - Verify results with both whole and decimal numbers.

* Folder should now be structured as followed:

    Unit##
    | -Exercise##
      | -Program
      | -Inputs

01.04: Creating and writing to an output file.
    - Create an output folder within the exercise folder.
    - Create a file called output.txt.
    - Repeat exercise 01.03 but write the program output to the 
        output.txt file.

* From this point on, each exercise folder is expected to have the
    following structure.

    Unit##
    | -Exercise##
      | -Program
      | -Inputs
      | -Outputs

01.05: Labeling and reading multiple inputs from an input file
    - Create an input file that has the following three input labels
        and a random number value, here is an example.
            a, 3.0
            b, 4.0
        Note: different languages may need a different structure.
    - Let the inputs "a" and "b" be the sides of a right triangle. 
        Have the program print out "c: #.##" in an output file.

01.06: Creating a structured output file
    - Create a program that creates a table of squares from 1 - 25.
    - Output the data into a file so that it is structured as the 
        following:
            1 1
            2 4
            3 9
    - Create two seperate output files one comma delimited (.csv) and
        another that is tab delimited (.txt).

01.07: Have the .exe read a user input on execution
    - Create a program that reads a number from when the program is
        executed squares it and prints it to an output file.

01.08: Create a "smart" file path system
    - Create a program that requires the user to enter the path to
        the bin folder.
    - Use this input to construct the paths to both the input files
        and output files.
    - Have the program read the input file and print it to an output
        file.

01.09: Have the program select which input file to use
    - Create five input files called one.txt, two.txt, etc to 
        five.txt that each have the titled number inside.
    - Have the executable take a text input and use the typed input
        file.
    - Write the cube of the number to an output file.
