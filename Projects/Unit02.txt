Unit 02: Lagrangian Mechanics
The objective of this unit is to learn about different time evolution
    methods and mechanics simulation techniques.

* The files should be output in a csv format so that the simulation can
    be animated using another program such as blender or p5js.

02.01: Double Pendulum with Euler Method.
    - Create a program that simulates a double pendulum using the Euler
        method.
    - Both masses and rod lengths of the double pendulum are to be equal.
    - Use an input file that takes in the following initial conditions:
        * length (length of the two rods)
        * theta1 (starting angle for the first mass)
        * theta2 (starting angle of the second mass)
        * deltaTime (the time step to use)
        * time (the total time the simulation runs)
    - Output data in the format:
        t, x1, y1, x2, y2

02.02: Double Pendulum with Midpoint Method.
